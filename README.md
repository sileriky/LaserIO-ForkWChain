Can't have DireWire without Wires!


This a fork, trying to achieve one thing: quicker linkage.

Currently, you click on a node to set it as an anchor, then link each subsequent one to each other node you want to have in the same network. This is going to be an attempt to implement another mode, where each time you link a new node, it becomes a new anchor, allowing for the creating of a smooth, point to point network, without having to set the anchor again each time.
